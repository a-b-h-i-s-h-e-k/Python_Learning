'''
Variable assignment in Python involves assigning a value to a variable using the assignment operator =. 
The variable on the left-hand side of the '=' operator is assigned the value on the right-hand side.

Rules for naming a variable:

1. The variable name must start with a letter or an underscore (_).
2. It cannot start with a number.
3. The name can contain letters, numbers, and underscores.
4. Variable names are case-sensitive (e.g., myVariable and myvariable are different).
5. Avoid using Python reserved keywords (e.g., if, else, for, while).

'''
-> Integers (int) represent whole numbers without a fractional part. 
They can be positive, negative, or zero.
-> Floating-point numbers (float) represent numbers that have a fractional part, 
i.e., numbers with decimals. They can also be positive, negative, or zero.

# Q.13


#-> A string in Python is a sequence of characters enclosed within single quotes ('), 
#double quotes ("), or triple quotes (''' or """). A string can contain letters, numbers, 
#symbols, and whitespace.

#-> A character is essentially a string of length 1, representing a single symbol or letter. 
#In Python, there is no distinct data type for characters; they are treated as strings of length 1.

# Q.13.b

greeting = "Hello World!"
print(greeting)

# Q.14.

# Comments in Python are used to add explanations or notes within the code, making it 
# easier to understand. They are ignored by the Python interpreter and do not affect 
# the execution of the program.

# -> Single-line comments: Start with the # symbol and extend to the end of the line.
# -> Multi-line comments: Typically use multiple # symbols at the beginning of each line. 
# Alternatively, triple quotes (''' or """) can be used to span multiple lines, though 
# they are technically multi-line strings.

# Q.14.b

# This is a single-line comment

"""
This is a multi-line comment.
It can span multiple lines.
